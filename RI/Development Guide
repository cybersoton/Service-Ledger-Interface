The Registry Interface is a key component of the SUNFISH architecture. It has two purposes. On one hand, it interacts with the fabric blockchain.
On the other hand, it provides web interfaces for other SUNFISH components to enable the interactions between those components and the blockchain. 

The flow control in the registry interface is as follows:

SUNFISH Component ====> ri.js --> *API.js --> hyperledger*.js ====> fabric ====> SUNFISH Component

The ri.js is the entry point of the registry interface. There are different hyperledger*.js files; each of which is responsible for interacting with a particular smart-contract.
There are also different *API.js files which are responsible for forwarding each request to the appropriate hyperledger*.js file. Currently, these *API.js files are configured to
hyperledger. However, if needed, this configuration can be changed in the config.ini file and also by developing required *.js files which interact with the other blockchain.

A SUNFISH component submits a request following the SUNFISH RI specification. Based on the request path, the request is forwarded
internally to the appropriate *API.js file. Then this file  forwards the request to the corresponding hyperledger*.js file where the request is handled.
